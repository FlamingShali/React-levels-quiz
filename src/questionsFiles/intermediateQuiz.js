    question: "What is the useEffect hook?",
    options: [
      "useEffect handles special effects in React applications like animations, color swap etc",
      "The useEffect hook is used to perform side effect in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM. It runs after every render by default but can be controlled using dependencies",

    options: [
      "Fetching data in React? Shouldn't backend care for that?",
      "You can use useFetch() hook which takes an url adress as a first argument and variable as a second argument where you store fetched data. It is a feature released with React 16",
      "You can fetch data from an API using the fetch function or a library like Axios within the useEffect hook to ensure the data is fetched after the component mounts",
      "In order to fetch data, you have to copy url with your endpoint and use it as an initial state in useState hook",

    question: "What is the useRef hook, and how is it used?",
    options: [
      "The useRef hook is used to store global state that persists across multiple renders and updates the component when changed",
      "The useRef hook creates a mutable object that persists across renders. It is often used to access or manipulate DOM elements directly and store values that donâ€™t trigger re-renders when changed",
      "It is a required hook for handling form validation and is necessary for every form input in React",

    question: "How does React handle forms?",
    options: [
      "React handles forms using controlled components, where form elements like <input> are controlled by React state, making it easier to manage user input form submission",
      "React automatically binds form inputs to variables, removing the need for state management",
      "Forms in React are handled using only class components, as functional components do not support input state management",

    options: [

    question: "What is lazy loading, and how do you implement it in React?",
    options: [
      "Lazy loading is the process of delaying the rendering of all components in an application until the user interacts with the page",
      "React does not support lazy loading, and all components must be loaded at the initial render",
      "Lazy loading is a technique to defer the loading of non-essential resources until they are needed. In React, you can implement lazy loading using React.lazy() and Suspense to load components only when they are needed",
      "Lazy loading is a feature that only works in Next.js and cannot be implemented in a standard React application",

  {
    question: "What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback hooks?",
    options: [
      "useMemo is used to memorize the result of a computation, avoiding recalculations unless dependencies change. useCallback is used to memorize a function, preventing it from being recreated on every render unless dependencies change",
      "useMemo and useCallback serve the same purpose and can be used interchangeably without any performance differences",
      "useCallback is used to store the result of a computation, while useMemo stores a reference to a function",

      "Removing useEffect and useState hooks can significantly improve performance since they slow down the application",
      "Using multiple instances of Redux and Context API together will always lead to better performance in large applications",
      "Performance can be optimized using techniques like code splitting, memorization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback), avoiding unnecessary re-renders, using useEffect with dependencies, and using a proper state management strategy",

    options: [
      "Server-side rendering means that JavaScript files are generated on the server and then executed on the client-side before rendering the UI",
      "SSR in React is the process of preloading all routes before rendering any component in the browser",
      "With SSR, React applications do not use JavaScript on the client-side at all, relying entirely on static HTML for interactivity",
      ": SSR is a technique where the HTML content is generated on the server for each request, improving performance and SEO. Next.js is a popular framework that enables SSR with React",

    options: [
      "Custom hooks are React components that allow you to reuse JSX code across multiple components",
      "The useReducer hook is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It accepts a reducer function and an initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function",
      "They replace built-in hooks like useState and useEffect and should be used instead of them",

      "Global state can only be managed using Redux, as React does not provide any built-in global state management solutions",
      "The best way to manage global state is by storing all component states inside local storage and retrieving them when needed",
